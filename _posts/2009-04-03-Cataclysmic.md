This is a computer game [Andrew Carter](http://www.andrewjonascarter.com)
and I developed for our software design course at [Memorial University](http://www.mun.ca). 
We developed the game in Java, so it should run on most machines; though we tested it primarily in windows. 
Iâ€™ve included the game, and some of the documentation we produced so you can get an idea for how we developed it.
