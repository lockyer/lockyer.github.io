Progeny was the capstone project of my engineering degree at
[Memorial University](http://www.mun.ca/).
It was a group project where I worked with [Chad Levesque](https://twitter.com/clevesque "Chad's Twitter"), [Shawn Josey](https://twitter.com/shawnjosey "Shawn's Twitter"), and
[Andrew Carter](http://www.andrewjonascarter.com). Each group worked with a project advisor from a relevant industry. 
[Source Studio](https://twitter.com/SourceStudio)
proposed the concept for our project as “a library for procedural generation of 3D art assets for 
games”. We focused on creating large-scale planetary bodies; we felt it would offer a 
great demonstration of the strengths of procedural techniques. A big thanks to Source Studio for 
use of their game engine, as well as the expert advise of [Alex Brown](https://twitter.com/CodeVault). Above is a video demonstrating the project in action.

We also did presentations. Our team came second in that 
competition, loosing out to what was admittedly a pretty sweet robotics project.
