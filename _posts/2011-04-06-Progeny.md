Progeny was the capstone project for our computer engineering bachelor degree at
[Memorial University](http://www.mun.ca/) 
It was a four man project involving Chad Levesque, Shawn Josey,
[Andrew Carter](http://www.andrewjonascarter.com), 
and I. Our class worked with project advisors from relevant industries. A local game studio, 
[Source Studio](https://twitter.com/SourceStudio) 
proposed the concept for our project as “a library for procedural generation of 3D art assets for 
games”. So we chose to focus on creating large-scale planetary bodies; we felt it would offer a 
great demonstration of the strengths of procedural techniques. A big thanks to Source Studio for 
use of their game engine, as well as the expert advise of Alex Brown. Above is a video demonstrating 
Progeny in action.

We were also tasked with presenting this project to peers. Our team came second in the presentation 
competition loosing out to what was admittedly a pretty sweet robotics project.
