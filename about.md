I'm Rob Lockyer; a professional software developer, and amateur artist. I make video games, and tools for game developers. I've been doing this for over five years; on projects like [Madden Football](https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl), and [Second Chance Heroes](http://www.2ndchanceheroes.com/).

I plan to use this site as a way to improve my writing skills as I document some of my personal projects, and anything else I happen to find interesting. I suppose that makes you my guinea pig, I hope you find the wood shavings to your liking. If you'd like to get in touch you can probably find your prefered method of contact below:
