I'm Rob Lockyer; a professional software developer, and amateur artist. I make video games, and tools for game developers. I've been doing this for over five years; on projects like [Madden](https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl), and [Second Chance Heroes](http://www.2ndchanceheroes.com/).

I plan to use this site as a way to improve my writing skills as I document some of my personal projects, and anything else I happen to find interesting. If you'd like to get in touch check out the links below

## Site Tech
This site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the static site generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and my own custom fork of the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme. I designed the logo myself using Adobe Illustrator. If you notice any issues with the site please let me know the browser and its version number.

GitHub Pages seems to be the most cost effective and secure way to host a blog that I know of, assuming you have the technical skills to maintain it. Which I realize is a big _if_, but it works for me. [Prose.io](http://prose.io/) simplifies the posting process so it's really not that different than using something like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) once you get everything set up.
