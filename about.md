I'm Rob Lockyer; a professional software developer, and an amateur artist.
I've been working on games and simulations for over five years now so
I'm hoping I can come up with some novel things to say regarding
game development, software design, and if I'm really ambitious, maybe even art.
If you'd like to get in touch you can send me an email at [RobLockyer@Gmail.com](mailto:RobLockyer@Gmail.com?subject=RobLockyer.com "Rob's Email") or message me on [Twitter](https://Twitter.com/RobLockyer "Rob's Twitter").
