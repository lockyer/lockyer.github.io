            Progeny was the capstone project for our computer engineering bachelor degree at
            <a title="Memorial University Official Website" href="http://www.mun.ca/">Memorial University</a>. 
            It was a four man project involving Chad Levesque, Shawn Josey,
            <a title="Andrew's personal website." href="http://www.andrewjonascarter.com/">Andrew Carter</a>, 
            and I. Our class worked with project advisors from relevant industries. A local game studio, 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/SourceStudio" title="Source Studio Twitter Account">Source Studio</a> 
            proposed the concept for our project as “a library for procedural generation of 3D art assets for 
            games”. So we chose to focus on creating large-scale planetary bodies; we felt it would offer a 
            great demonstration of the strengths of procedural techniques. A big thanks to Source Studio for 
            use of their game engine, as well as the expert advise of Alex Brown. Above is a video demonstrating 
            Progeny in action.

        We were also tasked with presenting this project to peers. Our team came second in the presentation 
        competition loosing out to what was admittedly a pretty sweet robotics project.

            This is a computer game 
            <a title="Andrew Carter's personal website." href="http://www.andrewjonascarter.com/" >Andrew Carter</a> 
            and I developed for our software design course at 
            <a title="Memorial University's official website." href="http://www.mun.ca">Memorial University</a>. 
            We developed the game in Java, so it should run on most machines; though we tested it primarily in windows. 
            I’ve included the game, and some of the documentation we produced so you can get an idea for how we developed it.
